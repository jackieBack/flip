# Backend Code for personal site, flip.rip

Full-stack Streamlit implementation, [see this repo](https://github.com/sapped/Authenticated-Full-Stack-Streamlit) for a template you can more quickly rip. This is for my personal website. I predominately use it to track my own goals, but the idea is to put it all here. It will continue to change, but figure I'd share what I make here.

## Goals Tracker
Create goals, which have optional amounts. Then track them. Store it in a Postgres DB, manage db with Pgadmin4, and GUI via Streamlit.

## TBU
- Users
- Format time on read entries from epoch float
